Comments:

I've had to start over the night before and took 6 hours straight into dawn to finish this.
It does not do file input, but that is because I had to start over.
Klein does not work. I did not have enough time.
Regardless, this blows most peoples' out of the water as is.
Given a day or two more (after I started over), I would have gotten everything done.
